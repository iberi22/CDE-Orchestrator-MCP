# 💚 Support CDE Orchestrator MCP

Thank you for considering supporting our project! CDE Orchestrator MCP is **100% free** for everyone, but voluntary contributions help us:

- 🔬 **Fund AI research** into ethical development practices
- 🌍 **Keep tools accessible** to individuals and small teams
- 📚 **Create educational resources** and documentation
- 🛠️ **Maintain infrastructure** (CI/CD, servers, testing)
- ❤️ **Support open-source dependencies** we rely on

---

## 🎯 Our Philosophy: Fair Source

**We believe in ethical monetization without barriers.**

- ✅ **No forced licensing:** Use our software freely (even commercially)
- ✅ **Honor system:** We trust you to support what you value
- ✅ **Transparent funding:** See exactly where money goes
- ✅ **Open source forever:** All derivatives must remain open

### Why Voluntary?

Traditional licensing creates friction:
- 🚫 Forces audits and compliance overhead
- 🚫 Blocks innovation from small teams
- 🚫 Creates legal uncertainty

**Voluntary support builds community:**
- ✅ Encourages collaboration
- ✅ Rewards value, not force
- ✅ Fosters goodwill and trust
