Each skill uses only ~100 tokens during metadata scanning to determine relevance. When activated, the full skill content loads at <5k tokens. Bundled resources only load as needed.\n\n**Q: What's the difference between Claude Skills and Agent Skills?**\n\nA: They are the same thing.\n\n**Q: Can I share skills with my team?**\n\nA: Yes! Skills can be shared via:\n\n- Git repositories (recommended)\n- Internal file sharing\n- Claude API for programmatic distribution\n- Enterprise-wide deployment features (coming soon)\n\n**Q: Do skills work with all Claude models?**\n\nA: Skills are available for Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Free tier users do not have access to Skills.\n\n**Q: Can skills call external APIs?**\n\nA: Yes, skills can include scripts that call external APIs. For complex API integrations, consider using MCP (Model Context Protocol) alongside skills.\n\n**Q: How does Claude decide which skill to use?**\n\nA: Claude scans all available skills' frontmatter (name and description), evaluates relevance to the current task, then loads the full content of relevant skills. Multiple skills can be loaded and composed together automatically.\n\n**Q: Can I use Skills and MCP together?**\n\nA: Absolutely! They complement each other. Use Skills for task-specific workflows and MCP for external data/API integration. The `mcp-builder` skill can even help you build MCP servers.\n\n**Q: Are there any costs beyond my Claude subscription?**\n\nA: No additional costs for using official skills. Community and custom skills are free to use, though some may require external services (APIs, databases, etc.) that have their own costs.\n\n**Q: Can I monetize custom skills?**\n\nA: Currently, there is no official marketplace for paid skills. Anthropic has mentioned plans for community contributions and a potential marketplace in the future.\n\n**Q: How do I update a skill?**\n\nA: For skills from git repositories, pull the latest changes. For manually installed skills, replace the skill folder with the updated version. Always test updates in a non-production environment first.\n\n</details>\n\n## \u2b50 Key Features\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>What makes Skills powerful?</strong></summary>\n\n**Composable** - Skills stack together automatically. Claude identifies which skills are needed and coordinates their use without manual intervention.\n\n**Portable** - Skills use the same format everywhere. Build once, use across Claude.ai, Claude Code CLI, Claude API, and custom agents.\n\n**Efficient** - Claude only loads what's needed, when it's needed through progressive disclosure. Skills use ~100 tokens for metadata scanning, <5k tokens for full instructions when activated, keeping Claude fast.\n\n**Powerful** - Skills can include executable code for tasks where traditional programming is more reliable than token generation.\n\n</details>\n\n## \ud83d\udcbc Use Cases\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Common scenarios where Skills excel</strong></summary>\n\nSkills excel in scenarios requiring reusable procedural knowledge:\n\n### Organizational Workflows\n- **Brand guidelines**: Color palettes, typography rules, and layout specifications that automatically apply when Claude creates presentations or documents\n- **Compliance procedures**: Legal policy checks, security reviews, data handling protocols\n- **Document templates**: Standardized contract reviews, report formatting, meeting notes\n\n### Domain Expertise\n- **Excel formulas**: Complex spreadsheet calculations, data analysis patterns, visualization templates\n- **PDF manipulation**: Text extraction, form handling, document merging and splitting\n- **Data analysis techniques**: Statistical methods, data cleaning workflows, reporting standards\n\n### Personal Preferences\n- **Note-taking systems**: Personal organizational methods, documentation styles\n- **Coding patterns**: Preferred frameworks, testing approaches, code review checklists\n- **Research methodologies**: Literature review processes, citation management, analysis frameworks\n\n**Example**: A brand guidelines skill containing your company's color palette (#2E5EAA, #F4B400), typography rules (Helvetica for headings, Georgia for body), and layout specifications automatically applies these standards whenever Claude creates presentations or documents\u2014ensuring consistency without manual intervention.\n\n</details>\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
